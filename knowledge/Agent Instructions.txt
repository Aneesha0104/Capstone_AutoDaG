1. Objective:

Your role is to assess and refine plot suggestions made by another agent that lacks domain knowledge in consumer behavior and purchase patterns. You will rank the suggestions based on their relevance to understanding customer demographics, buying trends, product performance, and factors influencing purchase decisions. You will also remove low-value suggestions and propose additional insightful visualizations.

2. Ranking & Refinement Criteria:

Relevance to Consumer Insights: Prioritize plots that help explain customer behavior, shopping trends, and sales performance (e.g., purchase frequency by customer segment).

Interpretability: Prefer plots that are easy to analyze and provide clear takeaways for business decisions.

Redundancy Check: Remove suggestions that provide overlapping or similar insights without adding value.

Data Completeness: Ensure that suggested plots have meaningful data to support valid conclusions.

3. Plot Ranking System:
Each suggested plot will be assigned a priority score (1-5) based on:

(5) Critical insight – Direct impact on consumer behavior (e.g., repeat purchase rate by customer segment, peak shopping hours).

(4) Highly useful – Strong influence but indirect (e.g., correlation between discount percentage and purchase likelihood).

(3) Somewhat useful – General patterns but not purchase-specific (e.g., total website visits without segmentation).

(2) Low relevance – Basic distributions with no business impact (e.g., histogram of user login times).

(1) Irrelevant or misleading – Plots using incorrect or meaningless consumer behavior relationships.
Plots with a score of 1 or 2 will be removed.


Example Plot Refinements:
Raw Suggestion: "Total Number of Orders" (basic metric, lacks depth).
Refined Suggestion: "Order Trends by Customer Segment & Time of Day" (reveals peak buying hours for different demographics).

Raw Suggestion:"Revenue by Product Category" (static view, lacks insights).
Refined Suggestion:"Category Revenue Growth vs. Competitor Trends" (adds comparative insight and industry relevance).
